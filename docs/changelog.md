<Update label="September 21, 2026" description="v0.0.92" tags={["Preprod", "Upcoming", "New Feature", "Documentation", "Institutional API", "Retail API"]} rss={{ title: "v0.0.92 - Crypto price markets documented: Up/Down, Above/Below, Price Range, One-Touch (preprod)", description: "Four automated Bitcoin market families settle on CF Benchmarks' BRTI index and are listed in preprod ahead of production. New Crypto Schema page documents the identifying instrument fields (crypto_market_type, crypto_horizon, interval_start/interval_end, outcome_strike, price_to_beat, crypto_range_*, crypto_hit_direction, crypto_settlement_price). The Retail API exposes the same terms as assetPriceTerms and index price history at GET /v1/asset-prices/history. Crypto FAQs cover settlement statistics, ties, timing and maintenance. Existing hand-listed year-end Bitcoin markets carry none of these fields." }}>
  - **Crypto price markets are documented ahead of their production listing.** Four automated Bitcoin market families settle on CF Benchmarks' Bitcoin Real-Time Index (`BRTI`): 15-minute and 60-minute **Up/Down** windows, hourly, daily and weekly **Above/Below** ladders, **Price Range** ladders on the same expiries, and monthly **One-Touch** ladders. They are listed in preprod today and reach production on the schedule announced here.
  - **Institutional API:** the new [Crypto Schema](/trader-guide/crypto-schema) page documents the identifying fields. Map on `crypto_market_type` (`updown`, `strike`, `range`, `hit`) and read the window from `interval_start` / `interval_end`, the threshold from `outcome_strike` or `crypto_range_lower` / `crypto_range_upper`, the Up/Down open value from `price_to_beat`, and the settled value from `crypto_settlement_price`. Filter reference data with `eventCategory=CRY` or `clearingSym=CPC-BTC`.
  - **Retail API:** markets carry a typed [`assetPriceTerms`](/api-reference/market/overview#crypto-price-market-fields) object with the same terms, and the new [Asset Prices API](/api-reference/asset-prices/overview) serves BRTI candles from `GET /v1/asset-prices/history`. Automated crypto markets have an empty `marketType`; identify them from `assetPriceTerms.marketType`.
  - **Settlement rules** are summarised in the new [Crypto FAQs](/faqs/crypto-faqs): Up/Down, Above/Below and Price Range settle on the simple average of the 60 one-second index prices from 59 seconds before the settlement instant up to and including it (a flat Up/Down window settles Up; a value equal to a strike settles Yes); One-Touch settles on a rolling 60-second 20% trimmed mean and may settle early.
  - **Existing hand-listed year-end Bitcoin markets are unchanged.** They carry none of the `crypto_*` fields, show `marketType: "futures"` and `assetPriceTerms: null`, and state their statistic in the market rules. The Data Guide's crypto examples now use real identifiers.

<Update label="September 19, 2026" description="Streaming best practices" tags={["Documentation", "Institutional API"]} rss={{ title: "Streaming best practices for gRPC Drop Copy", description: "New page: one long-lived Drop Copy stream per firm, persist resume_token after apply, do not cancel mid-replay. Concurrent stream cap is 20 pooled." }}>
  * **New [Streaming Best Practices](/streaming-endpoints/streaming-best-practices) page.** One long-lived `CreateDropCopySubscription` per firm and environment. Persist `resume_token` after you apply the batch. Do not put a short deadline on the streaming RPC and reconnect — that restarts replay and never catches up. Drop Copy has no per-order stream.
  * **20 concurrent gRPC streams per firm**, pooled across stream types. Market data is still 1000 symbols per stream; `CreateOrderSubscription` is not. Full table: [Rate Limits](/trader-guide/rate-limits#grpc-streaming).

  * **71 additional sports market types are now documented.** The `market_sport_type` inventory on [Sports Schema](/trader-guide/sports-schema) now matches the full set of sports market types registered by the exchange. Some values are already listed; others are registered ahead of their first listing. Treat every value in the inventory as one that can appear on an instrument. Instruments with no sport-specific value show their `outcome_type` value in the Retail `sportsMarketType` field (for example `futures`); see the new Generic Values section.
  * **Football (35 values):**
    * **Player props:** `football_player_receptions`, `football_player_passer_rating`, `football_player_interceptions_thrown`, `football_player_sacks`, `football_player_defensive_interceptions`, `football_player_field_goals_made`, `football_player_50_plus_yard_field_goals_made`, `football_player_fantasy_points_ppr`, and `football_player_scrimmage_yards`, plus the yes/no props `football_player_first_touchdown`, `football_player_most_passing_yards`, `football_player_most_rushing_yards`, and `football_player_most_receiving_yards`.
    * **Combined game totals:** passing and rushing touchdowns, passing and rushing yards, offensive yards, turnovers, defensive interceptions, fourth-down conversions, and a successful two-point conversion yes/no. `football_game_total_pass_yards` and `football_game_total_pass_touchdowns` are also reserved for combined receiving yards and receiving touchdowns.
    * **Selected-team totals:** `football_team_total_offensive_yards`, `football_team_total_first_downs`, and `football_team_total_defensive_special_teams_touchdowns`.
    * **Game outcomes:** `football_game_last_score`, `football_game_last_touchdown`, `football_game_race_to_points` (`outcome_strike` carries the points target; each target has three legs: away team, home team, Neither Team), `football_game_highest_scoring_quarter`, `football_game_possession_winner`, `football_game_tie`, `football_game_safety`, and `football_game_onside_kick_attempt`.
    * **Live in-game markets (registered, not yet listed):** `football_next_team_touchdown` and `football_next_team_field_goal`. When these list, each touchdown or field-goal number is one three-leg product (each team plus No TD or No FG); the first instance lists at kickoff and a new instance lists after each touchdown or made field goal.
  * **Baseball (3 values):** the player props `baseball_player_rbis` and `baseball_player_stolen_bases`, and the selected-team total `baseball_team_total_runs`.
  * **Esports (24 values):** series handicaps and totals (`esports_series_map_handicap`, `esports_series_total_maps`, `esports_series_game_handicap`, `esports_series_total_games`); per-map rounds handicap and total rounds for maps 1–4; per-game first blood, total kills, and kills odd/even for games 1–4. Map markets apply to round-based titles such as Counter-Strike 2 and Valorant; game markets apply to series-of-games titles such as League of Legends and Dota 2.
  * **New sports (9 values):** `boxing_match_winner`, `darts_match_winner`, `pickleball_match_winner`, `lacrosse_team_full_game_winner`, and table tennis (`table_tennis_match_winner` plus `table_tennis_set_1_winner` through `table_tennis_set_4_winner`).
  * **Generic values:** `moneyline`, `spreads`, `totals`, and `drawable_outcome` are documented as valid `market_sport_type` values. They have the same structure as the matching `outcome_type` value and appear on instruments that carry no sport-specific value, such as instruments created before the sport-specific values existed or hand-listed markets.
  * **Identify the market from structured metadata:** Retail uses `sportsMarketType`; Institutional uses `market_sport_type`. See [Sports Schema](/trader-guide/sports-schema) for the full inventory, the esports map/game note, and the football metadata profiles.

  * **Example slugs** (Major League Cricket): `aec-mlc-sfu-soe-2026-06-27` (San Francisco Unicorns vs Seattle Orcas), `aec-mlc-mny-lakr-2026-06-27` (MI New York vs Los Angeles Knight Riders).

  * **Soccer To Advance is live for the World Cup.** Knockout fixtures now list a To Advance market (`market_sport_type = soccer_game_to_advance`, Retail `sportsMarketType = "soccer_game_to_advance"`). It is created per knockout game once the main match market is open.
  * **Structure:** each knockout tie has **two separate instruments — one per team** (e.g. "Will South Africa advance?" and "Will Canada advance?"), each a binary Yes/No market. They resolve on the team that progresses over the **whole tie — regulation, extra time, and penalties** — not the 90-minute result.
  * **Decimalized 0.5 cent tick size (`$0.005`).** Do not assume 1 cent ticks. Read tick size per instrument before validating or submitting orders:
    * **Retail API:** `market.orderPriceMinTickSize` from `GET /v1/market/slug/{slug}` (expect `0.005`).
    * **Institutional API:** `instrument.tickSize` from `SearchInstruments` / `GetInstrument` (expect `0.005`); divide integer prices by `instrument.priceScale` (e.g. `priceScale == 1000` → `price = 5` is `$0.005`).
  * **Example slugs** (Round of 32, South Africa vs Canada, event `aadc-fwc-rsa-can-2026-06-28-to-advance`):
    * South Africa to advance: `aadc-fwc-rsa-can-2026-06-28-to-advance-rsa`

    * `instrument.fractionalQtyScale` — divide raw integer quantities by this to get decimal contracts. For example, with `fractionalQtyScale == 100`, `quantity = 1` is `0.01` contracts and `quantity = 100` is `1` full contract.
    * `instrument.minimumTradeQty` — the smallest tradable integer quantity.
    * Initial partials use `fractionalQtyScale == 100` and `minimumTradeQty == 1`, so the minimum order is **1% of a contract**.
    * On the `Order` message, `fractional_quantity_scale` (field 49) carries the same scale for converting `order_qty`, `cum_qty`, and `leaves_qty`.
  * **Retail API — read the minimum, then handle decimals:**
    * `minimumTradeQty` on the market object (for example `GET /v1/market/slug/{slug}`) is expressed in contracts, so `0.01` means a **1%-of-a-contract** minimum.
    * Treat `quantity`, `cumQuantity`, and `leavesQuantity` as decimals, and use the decimal portfolio fields (`netPositionDecimal`, `qtyBoughtDecimal`, …).

  * **NBA Finals Game 2:** New York vs. San Antonio Game 2 of the NBA Finals (`aec-nba-ny-sa-2026-06-05`) will be listed on **Monday, June 1, 2026** and will be the first market with a **0.5 cent** tick size (`$0.005`). The remainder of NBA Finals markets will also use **0.5 cent** ticks.
  * **Retail API:** read `market.orderPriceMinTickSize` from the market response before submitting orders. For this market, use `GET /v1/market/slug/aec-nba-ny-sa-2026-06-05` and expect `orderPriceMinTickSize: 0.005`.
  * **Institutional API:** read `instrument.tickSize` from instrument reference data (`SearchInstruments` / `GetInstrument`). For this instrument, `instrument.tickSize = 0.005`.
  * **Institutional price scale:** prices submitted to the Institutional API are integer values. Read `instrument.priceScale` from the same instrument reference data response and divide submitted or returned integer prices by that value to get dollar prices. For example, if `instrument.priceScale == 1000`, `price = 5` means `$0.005`, `price = 500` means `$0.50`, and `price = 1000` means `$1.00`. With a 0.5 cent tick and `priceScale == 1000`, valid integer prices move in 5-unit increments.

    * Applies to `GET /v1/markets`, `GET /v1/market/id/{id}`, `GET /v1/market/slug/{slug}`, and documented Retail API responses that embed the market object, including Events, Search, Sports, Sports Legacy, and Subjects.
    * `minimumTradeQty` is expressed in contracts. For example, `0.01` means the minimum order size is 1% of a contract.
    * `orderPriceMinTickSize` is expressed in dollars. For example, `0.005` means half-cent ticks.
  * **Market data:** order book and trade quantity fields can contain decimal contract quantities.
    * `GET /v1/markets/{slug}/book` and Markets WebSocket book levels return `qty` as a decimal string.
    * Markets WebSocket trade `quantity.value` is also a decimal string.

    * Order request and response `quantity`, `cumQuantity`, and `leavesQuantity` fields are JSON numbers and can contain decimals.
    * Private WebSocket order snapshots and updates use the same order quantity fields; execution `lastShares` is a decimal string.
    * Multi-leg execution `legPrices[].qty` is a decimal string.
    * Submit prices and quantities already aligned to the market's documented precision. Extra precision can be normalized in responses rather than rejected.
  * **Portfolio API:** use decimal quantity fields for positions and trades.
    * `GET /v1/portfolio/positions` returns `netPositionDecimal`, `qtyBoughtDecimal`, `qtySoldDecimal`, `bodPositionDecimal`, and `qtyAvailableDecimal`.
    * `GET /v1/portfolio/activities` trade payloads return `qtyDecimal`; the older trade `qty` field is rounded and deprecated.
    * Private WebSocket position messages can include `netPositionDecimal`, `qtyBoughtDecimal`, `qtySoldDecimal`, `bodPositionDecimal`, and `qtyAvailableDecimal`.
    * The older integer position fields `netPosition`, `qtyBought`, `qtySold`, `bodPosition`, and `qtyAvailable` remain for backward compatibility but are rounded and deprecated for partial-contract markets. `availablePositions` is also deprecated.

They appear on every Institutional Trading and Report response that returns an Order or Execution, including the gRPC order stream." }}>
  * **Two additive fields on the `Order` message:**
    * `fractional_quantity_scale` (field 49, `int64`) — the fractional quantity scale copied from the instrument at order creation time. Divide raw integer quantities (`order_qty`, `cum_qty`, `leaves_qty`, etc.) by this value to get the properly scaled decimal quantity.
    * `price_to_quantity_filled` (field 41, `map<int64, int64>`) — quantity filled at each price point over the life of the order. The key is the price, the value is the quantity filled at that price.
  * **Where they appear:** every response that returns an `Order` or an `Execution` (which embeds `Order`), across the Institutional Trading and Report APIs and the gRPC order stream:
    * Trading API: `GET /v1/trading/orders/open` (`GetOpenOrders`) and the `CreateOrderSubscription` stream (snapshot orders and `update.executions[].order`).

  * **Partial contracts in preprod:** `aec-mlb-az-mil-2026-06-15` is open in preprod as a dummy partial contract instrument.
    * Read `instrument.fractionalQtyScale` to determine how submitted integer order quantities are scaled. For example, if `instrument.fractionalQtyScale == 100`, submitting `quantity = 1` means 0.01 contracts, `quantity = 50` means 0.50 contracts, and `quantity = 100` means 1 full contract.
    * Read `instrument.minimumTradeQty` for the lowest scaled integer quantity that can be traded. For example, if `instrument.minimumTradeQty == 1` and `instrument.fractionalQtyScale == 100`, the minimum valid order quantity is `1`, which represents 0.01 contracts, or 1% of a contract.
    * Initial partial contract instruments will have `instrument.fractionalQtyScale == 100` and `instrument.minimumTradeQty == 1`, meaning the minimum order size is **1% of a contract**.
  * **Decimalization in preprod:** dummy instruments are open in preprod for smaller tick-size handling:
    * `aec-nba-mil-was-2026-06-15` has a **0.5c** tick size.
    * `aec-nhl-edm-ana-2026-06-15` has a **0.25c** tick size.
    * Read `instrument.priceScale` to determine how submitted integer order prices are scaled. For example, if `instrument.priceScale == 1000`, submitting `price = 5` means \$0.005, `price = 500` means \$0.50, and `price = 1000` means \$1.00.
    * Read `instrument.tickSize` for the tick size in dollars. For example, a 0.5c tick size is expressed as `instrument.tickSize = 0.005`, and a 0.25c tick size is expressed as `instrument.tickSize = 0.0025`.

  * **New ledger endpoints** for reconciliation, point-in-time replay, and end-of-day reporting:
    * **Position ledger (REST):** `GET /v1/positions/ledger`, `GET /v1/positions/ledger/download` — paginated query + streamed CSV of position changes (with both deltas and post-change cumulative state). See [Position Ledger](/institutional/positions/overview#position-ledger).

    * **Balance ledger (gRPC):** `CreateBalanceLedgerSubscription` for real-time push of balance ledger entries. See [Balance Ledger Stream](/streaming-endpoints/balance-ledger-stream).
    * All three are scoped under `read:positions`. Both ledgers enforce a hard historical floor of **`2026-05-01T00:00:00Z`**; pre-floor entries are not retrievable.
  * **`InstrumentStats` additions** on the market data stream and `GetOrderBook` / `GetBBO` responses:
    * `last_trade_qty` (field 14, `optional int64`) — quantity of the most recent trade. Populated after any trade executes on the instrument.
    * `settlement_set_time` (field 15, `optional google.protobuf.Timestamp`) — timestamp when the settlement price was set. Populated only when the instrument is in a settled state.
  * **New `KeepAliveCommand`** on `BiDirectionalStreamMarketDataRequest` (field `keepalive = 7`). Sending one puts a client-to-server frame on the wire without modifying subscription state; the server returns no response. Solves the AWS Application Load Balancer 1-hour idle timeout (`RST_STREAM`) for long-lived bidirectional subscriptions with no client-to-server traffic. Recommended cadence: every **30–60 minutes** (well below the 3600s ALB timeout). Only applies to `BiDirectionalStreamMarketData`; server-streaming `CreateMarketDataSubscription` is not affected.
  * **Stream limits relaxed:** the per-firm cap is now **20 concurrent streams** with no per-stream-type restrictions. Previously, some stream types had individual caps; now the 20-stream budget is pooled across all gRPC subscriptions.
  * **Action recommended:** rebuild your gRPC clients from the latest proto bundle to pick up the new endpoints and additive fields above.
