# Events & Markets

> Understanding how prediction markets are structured on Polymarket US.

Every prediction on Polymarket US is structured around three levels: **series**, **events**, and **markets**. Understanding how they relate is essential for finding what you want to trade.

## Series

A series is a broad grouping of related events — like a sports league or a season. Think of it as a folder that contains many games or occurrences.

**Examples:** NFL 2025-26 Season, NBA 2025-26 Season, March Madness 2026

## Events

An event is a specific occurrence within a series — usually a single game, match, or contest. Each event has a start time, participants, and one or more markets attached to it.

**Examples:** Chiefs vs Eagles — Feb 9, 2026, Lakers vs Celtics — Jan 15, 2026

## Markets

A market is the actual thing you trade. It's a single yes/no question about an event. Each market settles at \$1.00 if the outcome happens and \$0.00 if it doesn't.

One event can have multiple markets. For example, a single NFL game might have:

| Market type   | Question                                  | Example                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Moneyline** | Who wins?                                 | Will the Chiefs win?   |
| **Spread**    | Will they win by more than X points?      | Chiefs -3.5            |
| **Total**     | Will the combined score be over/under X?  | Total points over 47.5 |
| **Prop**      | Will a specific thing happen in the game? | Mahomes over 2.5 TDs   |

```
Series: NFL 2025-26 Season
  └── Event: Chiefs vs Eagles — Feb 9, 2026
        ├── Market: Will the Chiefs win? (moneyline)
        ├── Market: Chiefs -3.5 (spread)
        └── Market: Total points over 47.5 (total)
```

## Crypto price markets

Crypto price markets follow the same three levels, but the event is a time window or an expiry rather than a game. A series groups one asset, one market family and one cadence (for example `btc-updown-15m`); an Up/Down event holds a single market for one window, while an Above/Below or Price Range event holds one market per strike or bucket, all expiring at the same instant.

```
Series: btc-strike-daily
  └── Event: btc-above-day-2026-09-21 (expires 5:00 PM ET)
        ├── Market: $73,500 or above
        ├── Market: $74,000 or above
        └── Market: $74,500 or above
```

Each market carries a typed `assetPriceTerms` object with the window, strike or range bounds, the reference price to beat and, once settled, the settlement price. See [Crypto Price Market Fields](/api-reference/market/overview#crypto-price-market-fields).

## Market slugs

Every market has a **slug** — a URL-friendly identifier like `aec-nfl-kc-phi-2026-02-09`. This is what you use everywhere: placing orders, fetching order books, subscribing to WebSocket streams.

You can find slugs by searching or browsing markets through the API.

## Live sports data

For sports events that are in progress, you get real-time metadata like the current score, period, and whether the game has ended. This is useful if you're building applications that react to live game state.
