# Modify Multiple Orders

> Modify up to 20 existing orders in a single request. Each entry is forwarded to the exchange as a cancel-replace. If any entry fails request-shape validation, the whole batch is rejected by the gateway before reaching the exchange. The exchange may silently ignore unknown `orderId`s. `modifiedOrderIds` is an echo of the request, not a confirmation; observe actual outcomes on the order stream.
