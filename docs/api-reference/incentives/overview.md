# Incentives API Overview

> View incentive programs and your earned rewards

# Incentives API

The Incentives API exposes the active incentive programs and the rewards you have earned. For background on how programs work and their reward formulas, see the [Incentive Programs overview](/incentives/overview); for how liquidity programs score — Target Size, Discount Factor, and Max Spread — see the [Liquidity Incentive Program](/incentives/liquidity) page.

## Base URL

```
https://api.polymarket.us
```

<Note>
  **Field casing.** Query parameters are `snake_case` (e.g. `page_size`). Response bodies are `lowerCamelCase` (e.g. `marketSlug`). Sending a camelCase query parameter (e.g. `pageSize`) is silently ignored and the default is used.

<Note>
  **Reading `maxSpread`.** A liquidity program may carry a maximum spread from the midpoint. Where it does:

  * **Units.** `maxSpread` is in price dollars of a \$1 contract (`0.035` = 3.5¢). The docs pages and polymarket.us/rewards quote the same value in cents; the API always returns dollars. It is a **half-width**: the two sides may be up to 2 × `maxSpread` apart (3.5¢ from the midpoint = a 7¢ gap).
  * **What is compared.** Once per sampled second, each side of the book is walked from its best price outward, one whole price level at a time, until the resting size on that side (all participants combined) reaches `targetSize`. The price level that gets there is that side's *size-adjusted price*. The midpoint is halfway between the two size-adjusted prices — not the best-bid/best-offer midpoint. A small order at the best price counts toward that side's depth like any other order; it moves the size-adjusted price only when it is what carries the side to `targetSize`.
  * **Pass / fail.** This is a test of the book, not of each trader: you do not have to quote both sides yourself. The second is scored as usual (every order from the best price through the size-adjusted price qualifies, weighted by its distance from that side's best price and by its size) when both sides reach `targetSize` and each size-adjusted price is no more than `maxSpread` from the midpoint — a gap of exactly 2 × `maxSpread` passes. If either side never reaches `targetSize`, or the gap is wider than 2 × `maxSpread`, **nobody is paid for that second**, including makers quoting tightly and including a side that did reach `targetSize`. Once a second qualifies, a one-sided quote still earns on the side it rests on. A failed second still counts toward the period's total, so its share of `rewardPool` is forfeited, not shifted to other seconds or other makers.
  * **Tick size.** The check is in dollars, so a given `maxSpread` means the same thing on 1¢-tick and 0.1¢-tick markets.
  * **Omission.** The key is absent (never `0`) when a program has no Max Spread; it is a `liquidityProgram` field. Programs without a Max Spread score each side independently, as before.
  * **Scope.** The value applies to every scored second of that `timePeriods[]` entry. Parameters can differ between time periods of the same market, so read `maxSpread` per entry rather than per market.
