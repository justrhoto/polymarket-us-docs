        SettlementPriceCalculationMethod indicates the settlement price
        calculation method of the book.

         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_VWAP_TIER_1: If using the VWAP Settlement Price Logic, indicates that there were enough trades to calculate the settlement price using Volume Weighted Average Price
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_VWAP_TIER_2_RULE_1: If using the VWAP Settlement Price Logic, indicates that there weren't enough trades to calculate the settlement price using VWAP, and the Best Bid / Best Ask / Last Trade / Previous Settlement logic was used instead, with Best Bid / Best Ask / Last Trade existing.
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_VWAP_TIER_2_RULE_2: If using the VWAP Settlement Price Logic, indicates that there weren't enough trades to calculate the settlement price using VWAP, and the Best Bid / Best Ask / Last Trade / Previous Settlement logic was used instead, with Best Bid / Best Ask existing and Last Trade not existing.
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_VWAP_TIER_2_RULE_3: If using the VWAP Settlement Price Logic, indicates that there weren't enough trades to calculate the settlement price using VWAP, and the Best Bid / Best Ask / Last Trade / Previous Settlement logic was used instead, with Best Bid / Last Trade existing and Best Ask not existing.

         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_EVENT_TIER_1: Indicates that the settlement price was set as a result of "PerformResolution".  In addition, settlement prices that have this calculation method are considered final and will no longer be updated by the Settlement Price Module.
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_EVENT_TIER_2: If using the EVENT Settlement Price Logic, indicates that the settlement price was set to the price of the trading day's latest trade for the Opposing Side = "As Defined" sub type
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_EVENT_TIER_3: If using the EVENT Settlement Price Logic, indicates that at the market close no trades for the Opposing Side = "As Defined" sub type during the trade day, and therefore the settlement price was set to the current settlement price
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_EVENT_TIER_4: If using the EVENT Settlement Price Logic, indicates that there were no trades for the Opposing Side = "As Defined" sub type during the trade day, nor current settlement price, and therefore the settlement price was set to 0
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_OVERRIDE: Indicates the calculated settlement price was overridden by the exchange
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_VWAP_TIER_2_RULE_5: If using the VWAP Settlement Price Logic, indicates that there weren't enough trades to calculate the settlement price using VWAP, and the Best Bid / Best Ask / Last Trade / Previous Settlement logic was used instead, with Best Ask / Last Trade existing and Best Bid not existing.
         - SETTLEMENT_PRICE_CALCULATION_METHOD_VWAP_TIER_2_RULE_6: If using the VWAP Settlement Price Logic, indicates that there weren't enough trades to calculate the settlement price using VWAP, and the Best Bid / Best Ask / Last Trade / Previous Settlement logic was used instead, with Best Ask existing and Best Bid / Last Trade not existing.
